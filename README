DESCRIPTION

This module will allow transactions to be sent through the FedEx Ship Manager API.  
The API must be installed and running for this module to work.
At this point it is required to run this module in a Win32 environment.  
The FedEx API is distributed with a DLL "FedExAPIclient.dll" which is called via Win32::API.
Please make sure this file is copied into your system32 folder.

Please refer to the FedEx documentation at http://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/
Here you will find more information about using the FedEx API.  You will need to know
what UTI to use to send a request.

The Universal Transaction Identifier (UTI) is a unique integral code that has been assigned to a 
given transaction type.
For example, the UTI of the tagged Transaction Type 021 (FedEx Express global Ship a Package Request) 
is 2016.

I have not included the proxy portion of the module.  So this is a Win32 ONLY module.
Soon, I will be releasing a version that will talk directly to FedEx's API via HTTP.
